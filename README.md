# todo-list
Todo List  Using Bootstrap CSS, jQuery and everything you know about life, create a Todo List! Your Todo List app will have two main columns (up to you how to format them). Each “todo” should be in a list with the following items: Todo Title Delete button Checkbox  Clicking the checkbox will draw a line through the title and remove the “checkbox” for that row. Clicking “Delete” will delete the item altogether. In the other column, have a form for inputting a new “Todo” which gets added to the list.
